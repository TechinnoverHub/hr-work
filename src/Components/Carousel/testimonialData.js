We have always interviewed candidates ourselves but felt we needed some help for such Key and strategic roles. The manner in which HR Work managed the process made us have a rethink about our own approach. The interviewing techniques brought out amazing information from the candidates and we were indeed sure that we had made the right choice at the end of the process. They gave a 6week mandate to complete all the roles but finished all roles in 4weeks! Amazing database and technical approach to recruiting! Great value for money.`,
